## Overview

This is a Turing School of Software and Design Module 2 project. This project consisted of building a static application interface based on a provided comp. The display needed to be fully responsive and have cross browser compatiability for Safari, Chrome, and Firefox. All images and icons were not provided and had to be sourced. Creative liberties were encouraged and this interface includes an appealing color palette as well as an artist Co Op theme. 

## Setup
